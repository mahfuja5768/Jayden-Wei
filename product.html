              Climate change has become a defining and genuine global issue. We
              atJayden Wei OGBC fintech banking are rightly facing the challenge
              head-on, by becoming one of the first banks to join the net zero
              revolution. Symbolising our commitment, we are one of the first
              companies to set KPIs for financial emissions. This encompasses
              our role across borrowing and lending activities and is arguably
              one of the most comprehensive environmental targets prescribed by
              any bank worldwide. As such, this unifies collective efforts
              towards addressing the infamous issue of climate change.
